                            -	The user interface shall allow the user to specify the text file to be processed.<br />
                            -	This file shall be analyzed and all the words within the file shall be extracted and counted.<br />
                            -	As a result, a simple two-column table shall be shown.<br />
                            -	The first column shall contain words, while the second one shall contain their occurrences.<br />
                            -	The table shall be sorted by the number of occurrences.<br />
                            -	The user shall be able to cancel the processing of the file.<br />

                            -	The program shall read an ANSI text file. The file to be read shall be specified by the user.<br />
                            -	Separating the words out of the text file is only based on white space characters
                            (space, LR, CR, ...). Handling punctuation marks is beyond the scope of this assignment.<br />
                            -	It shall be considered that large text files (~50 MB) will be processed, and as such,
                            the user interface shall show a progress bar.<br />
                            -	It shall be possible to abort the program while parsing the text file.<br />
                            -	The file parsing logic, responsible for extracting the words out of the input file should be
                            modular and reusable. This is because this logic is intended to be reused in a future project.<br />
                            -	It is desired that the parsing of the file offers decent performance.<br />
                            -	The user interface is required to be responsive even during parsing the file so that the user
                            can still interact with the application (e.g. when he/she wants to cancel the file processing).<br />
